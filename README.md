# atariVT

- Just a little project to repurpose my Atari 400 as a server monitor.
- Uses AspectQT on the host with sio2usb connector (FTDI) to the 400 SIO.
- Host acts as 810 floppy drive to boot the 400 (D1:../ATR/ATARIVT.ATR)
- Host server script formats and streams sytem data frames to shared folder (D2:../ATR)
- Used Atari800 (Altirra) Emulator for development with 8K Atari 400 build target.
